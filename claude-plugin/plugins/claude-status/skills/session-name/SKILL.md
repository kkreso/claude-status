# Set Session Name

Sets a custom display name for the current Claude Code session in the Claude Status macOS menu bar app.

## Usage

```
/name-session <name>
```

## Steps

1. Extract the desired session name from the user's arguments. If no name was provided, ask the user what they'd like to name this session.

2. Run the set-session-name.sh script from the plugin:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/set-session-name.sh" "<session-name>"
```

The script updates the session's `.cstatus` file with a `session_name` field. The hook script carries this name forward on subsequent status updates.

3. Confirm to the user that the session name was set.

## Examples

- `/name-session API Refactor` — names the session "API Refactor"
- `/name-session Bug Hunt` — names the session "Bug Hunt"
